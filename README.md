# Forecasting purchase order values and volumes

The aim was to create monthly forecasts with available data (which is limit of the data due to less number of observations in the past).
\nFor forecasting I am using the ETS model with authomatically estimated parameters. 
\nForecasts are pushed to Celonis in order to visualise it for the end user.
