# Forecasting purchase order values and volumes

- the aim was to create monthly forecasts with available data (only 3 years back which is limit of the data due to less number of observations in the past)

- using ETS model with authomatically estimated parameters + generated confidence intervals

- forecasts are pushed to Celonis in order to visualise it for the end user
